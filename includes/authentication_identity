<h1 id='authentication-amp-identity'>Authentication &amp; Identity</h1><h2 id='authentication-amp-identity-identity-with-erc-725'>Identity with ERC 725</h2>
<p>Users identities are tied to Ethereum addresses and your private keys are used as the sole method of authentication on the Origin platform.</p>

<p>Users can always prove ownership of a wallet without sending funds, simply by signing a message using their private keys.</p>

<p>Users can assume multiple identities by creating multiple wallets. In this manner, users can choose how much of their off-line identities they wish to reveal to other users while participating on the Origin network.</p>

<p>We are using the <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/725">ERC 725</a> identity standard as proposed by <a href="https://github.com/frozeman">Fabian Vogelsteller</a> as the basis for identity on the Origin platform. We&#39;ve built an <a href="https://erc725.originprotocol.com">identity playground</a> to help people understand ERC 725 and how it works. </p>

<p>The Origin run bridge server will provide identity attestations as a community service. Origin identities are portable not only across marketplaces built on our platform, but also with other DApps that are supporting the ERC 725 standard.</p>

Make sure to safely store your private keys. We can't help if you lose them.
